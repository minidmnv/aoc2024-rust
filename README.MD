## Features

## Download

Available releases can be downloaded for your platform of choice on the [Releases](https://github.com/zaszi/rust-template/releases) page. These are merely provided as an example on how the asset uploading works, and aren't actually useful by themselves beyond what a `hello world` program can provide.

## Building

Once the prerequisites have been installed, compilation on your native platform is as simple as running the following in a terminal:

```
cargo build --release
```
